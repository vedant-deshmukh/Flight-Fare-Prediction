<h1> Flight Fare Prediction System </h1> <br>
This is a project taken under the internship provided by Ineuron.ai.

## Problem Statement:<br>

The Problem statement is to analyze the dataset provided by them that contains the information of different flights that flew accross different cities in India.
We had to create a Machine Learning Model that can predict the flight fare depending upon the input by the user and create a UI for the same.

## What we used? <br>
We have used Python Libraries for data analysis and model creation (backend) and HTML and CSS for creating Web UI for the project.

## Web UI: <br>

### 1. Landing Page <br>
When the User land on our webpage, he/she sees a webpage welcoming them to Flight Fare Prediction System and ask them to move further by clicking on the ‘Lets Go!’ button.

<br>
### 2. Predictor Page<br>
This is the next page that can be accessed by clicking on ‘Lets Go!’ button on the homepage or by clicking on predictor tab in the navigation bar on the homepage The user sees various fields asking for information that is required to predict the price of a flight. Every user input has its own dropdown where the user can select their input. After providing the required input and pressing the submit button, the page refreshes and displays the predicted price of the flight.<br>

 ## User Input: <br>
 On the predictor page, the user has to provide all the information asked for the prediction. The user can select from the drop down lists attached to each of the input fields. Once, all the asked information is provided, the user clicks on submit button to get the output.<br>

<br>
## Output: <br>
On the predictor page, the user provides all the asked information and then clicks on submit button. The predicted fare of the selected flight is displayed to the user. <br>
