<h1> Flight Fare Prediction System </h1> <br>
This is a project taken under the internship provided by Ineuron.ai.

## Problem Statement:<br>

The Problem statement is to analyze the dataset provided by them that contains the information of different flights that flew accross different cities in India.
We had to create a Machine Learning Model that can predict the flight fare depending upon the input by the user and create a UI for the same.

## What we used? <br>
We have used Python Libraries for data analysis and model creation (backend) and HTML and CSS for creating Web UI for the project.

## Web UI: <br>

### 1. Landing Page <br>
When the User land on our webpage, he/she sees a webpage welcoming them to Flight Fare Prediction System and ask them to move further by clicking on the ‘Lets Go!’ button.
